# Linear Algebra Done Right

## Guidelines

This semester we will start to study the Linear Algebra from a higher view, to know how matrices are defined, and their properties. They are not just "table of numbers", all the definitions are with reasons. Remember that some people say that Functional Analysis is the Linear Algebra in infinitely dimensional spaces, which reveals the relationship between Linear Algebra and Analysis.

At the beginning, I state that a (canonical) matrix is a linear operator from two finitely dimensional Hilbert spaces.

What is an **operator**? It is another name of **map**, of function, defined on two sets.

What is a **Hilbert space**? This is a quite long story: let us construct it step by step. Image that we have a collection of **elements**, and we put it together, it becomes a **set**. Then, we want to associate it with some so-called **algebraic properties** on this set: commutativity, associativity and so on... that means, we have created "add" and "multiply" on this set, now we can call our set a **vector space** or **linear space**. Notice that scalar multiplication depends on a **field**, we say it is the field associated to vector space. It is not end yet, if we want to study the distance between two elements, we need our old friend **norm**, defined as in the former articles; we call the vector space with a norm structure as **normed vector space**. If we are lucky enough, we can even construct **inner product** based on the norm, which is the tool to study the "angle" between to vector, then the geometry appears! We call the vector space with inner product structure as **inner product space**, and the **complete** (luckily every finite dimensional vector space is complete) inner product space is call **Hilbert space**.

**(In short: set -> vector space -> normed vector space -> inner product space)**

As you can see: matrix is not strange for us, it is just a function, the terminology we have met in the junior high school! So do not be afraid, love it and study it!
